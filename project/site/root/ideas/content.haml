      I recently developed jQCloud, an open source jQuery plugin to make beautiful pure HTML word clouds and tag clouds. You can see a demo

      My current workplace, where I perform some research and develop web apps to support experiential learning in the Business School. It is a cool place, in which our crew of alpha geeks performs a lot of creative hacks and code kung fu. Many of the creative ninjas I know have been part of this lab at some point.

    %p
      Have you ever thought about the fact that huge networks of active Internet users, like Twitter or the Web itself, may display a self-organizing behavior and emergent computational capabilities? I'm doing some research and my master thesis on this...

      This HTML + CSS + JavaScript

      is just a random experiment, but it would make a cool geeky login interface for a hacker site... If you want to use it, mod it and make it better let me know!

      Developed years ago,
      = link_to "VirtualPlantz", "http://www.virtualplantz.com"
      was one of my first complete web app. I developed it for fun, but it eventually thousands of users registered and helped me win a couple of competitions. It was a sort of pre-facebook-boom FarmVille.
